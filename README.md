# CS330-3D-Scene
A lightweight C++/OpenGL demo that builds a “bee in the garden” 3D scene from scratch—complete with textured ground, trees, leaves and props—using a modular scene manager, custom shaders, and tag-based resource handling to teach real-time rendering and software design fundamentals.
